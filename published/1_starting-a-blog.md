## Let's do this

So...I've gone through a somewhat unique experience recently that allowed me to interview/have conversations with many folks. In doing so, I realized a few things.

1. It is incredibly draining to go through many interviews, especially multiple interviews within a couple weeks.
2. The key is to stay positive and upbeat. No one wants to talk to someone who's already given up before they even start the interview.
3. I should start a blog.

There's more items, but those are just the few that come to mind quickly...and the last item is the reason why I'm putting this together. I was asked multiple times if I have a blog. My response was along the lines of "You know, I've always wanted to have a blog...but...I don't. I don't have a blog." That was mostly true. I have always wanted to have a blog, that is definitely true. The "I don't have a blog" is only partially true. I've tried, on multiple occasions, to start and keep a blog going. I've been successful at starting, but for some reason, I can never keep up. I don't know what it is? Otherwise, I'd have figured it out by now. Time restraints? That's just an excuse. Regardless, here I go again.

I hope that this time I can keep it going. I think it'd be cool to be able to share my thoughts & experiences along the way. Who knows? Maybe one day, someone may actually read my posts? That'd be pretty cool.

I don't know that I'll have a focused blog. I feel I want to write about whatever comes to mind. My mind holds many different thoughts from many different worlds. You're either going to love this, or hate this. At the end of the day, you are free to read or not. From my perspective, I'd like to just get it out there.

Thanks in advance!
